**Figuring out how to make your Rmarkdown website (or document) look pretty is something that I have spent a long time struggling with. Here is a list of some tips and tricks I have come across in my travels...** 

*First of all, see [this](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/rmarkdown-cheatsheet.pdf) cheatsheet; the things I'm covering here are those not listed on this cheatsheet*

Additionally, [this](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/rmarkdown-site.html), specifically section 10.5 is an AMAZING resource for what you can do with an RMarkdown site. 

##Change size of image

This one is tricky, Rmarkdown does not like this.

```{r, eval=F}
![]("pics/yourphoto.jpg"){width = 250px}
```

Within your header you can also control the figure width and height, although this means all figures will be rendered the same size in your the document:

```{r, eval=F}
---
title: "My Site"
output:
  html_document:
    fig_width: 7
    fig_height: 6
---    
```


##Center your text/photos

```{r, eval=F}
<center> #put around the image/text
  
#Example:
  
  <center> Hello, world! <center>
  
```

##Add breaks

```{r, eval=F}
<br> #to add a white space
  
*** # to add a horizontal line break (example below) 
```

***

##Adding Table of Contents (TOC)

TOCs need to be added in your header. You can make the tocs float (follow you as you scroll down the page) or remain at the top of the page. 

```{r, eval=F}

#Example header

title: "Coding Practice"
output:
  html_document:
    toc: TRUE
    toc_float: TRUE
    toc_depth: 2   #how many "#" Rstudio will look for to make a new tab. If not specified, it will default to 3

```

##Adding Tabs 

To control the appearence of tabs you can use .tabset-fade (which causes tabs to fade in and out when switching between tabs) and .tabset-pills (which looks more like a button than a tab)

```{r, eval=F}

## The Letters {.tabset .tabset-fade}

### <small>A</small>  #you can change small to large for bigger text 

### <small>B</small>

### <small>C</small>

### <small>D</small>

#Example below 

```

## The Letters {.tabset .tabset-fade}

### <small>A</small>

A is for apple

### <small>B</small>

B is for boy

### <small>C</small>

C is for car

### <small>D</small>

D is for damn you kept clicking the tabs

<br>

##Themes

There a few different themes you can use for a simple RMarkdown website or document. The theme needs to be included in the header.
Themes already installed in your RStudio include: "cerulean”, “cosmo”, “flatly”, “journal”, “lumen”, “paper”, “readable”, “sandstone”, “simplex”, “spacelab”, “united”, and “yeti”. 

[Here](http://www.datadreaming.org/post/r-markdown-theme-gallery/)is a good website to look at a screen shot of each theme.

There are several add-on R packages that you can install to implement even more R Markdown HTML themes. For example `prettydoc`, `rmdformats`, `hrbrthemes`, `tufte`, and `tint`. See the website link above for screenshots of those themes.

How did I make those words appear in R code? 
```{r}

# `like this`

```

## Handy code for embedding a PDF

I use this handy piece of CSS code (thanks John Mola!) on my own website for embedding my CV. Notice here R is looking for a folder called "pdf"

```{r, eval=F}

<object data="/pdf/yourpdf.pdf" type="application/pdf" width="800px" height="800px">
    <embed src="/pdf/yourpdf.pdf">
        This browser does not support PDFs. Please download the PDF to view it: <a href="/pdf/yourpdf.pdf">Download PDF</a>.</p>
    </embed>
</object>
```
