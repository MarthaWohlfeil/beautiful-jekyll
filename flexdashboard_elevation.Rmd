##  Overview {.sidebar}

### Overview

During the breeding season, it is generally thought that birds arrive on their breeding ground, quickly claim a territory, and remain on that territory for the whole season. However, new studies, including my dissertation research, are calling that assumption into question. Through point count surveys and modeling techniques, I have found that some species of birds  consistently move up or down slope as the breeding season progresses, and my research aims to determine why some species are moving elevationally while others are not.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

#### Background

The Great Basin is home to over 300 species of breeding birds. My lab group has been surveying sites in the Great Basin since 2001. We have collected data on avian occupancy and abundance, vegetation, nest sites, and more recently for my dissertation work microclimate and insect biomass. Because we visit each location three times per season and survey for birds, I was able to create models that examined how the avian community changes throughout the breeding season. 

Using statistical models, I found some interesting results that I am just starting to dive into. First, I found that some species of passerines (songbirds) move upslope every year as the breeding season progresses, and that some move downslope. Through data collection and statistical modeling I hope to understand why some species are moving while others are not.

Second, I have found that some species of birds seem to have shifted their ranges up or downslope over the last 15 years. My lab's long-term data set has been invaluable to uncovering this apparent pattern, and unsurprisingly the strongest range shifts come from the sites we have been continuously surveying the longest. Could changing climate be the culprit? Through statistical modeling, and a better understanding of microclimate in the Great Basin ranges, I hope to find out. 

What sort of data are we collecting to answer these questions? All sorts! 

  + Avian occupancy and abundance
  + Vegetational composition of sites
  + Nest sites for specific species (dissertation work of Frank Forgarty)
  + Microclimate using HOBO data loggers
  + Insect biomass using sticky traps and malaise traps
  + Phenology of plant species known to be part of passerine diet
  
Through this data collection and statistical models, I hope to influence avian conservation decisions in the Great Basin, and examine current conservation practices in the context of passerine species.

# Cassin's Finch Example 

## Example {.sidebar}

### Upslope Movement

Here is an example of within-season elevational movement data from Cassin's Finch (*Haemorhous cassinii*). You can see the raw data plotted, and the model output. Visit one corresponds to earliest in the season, and visit three to the latest in the season. The model output is the probability density function of the posterior distrubition of a MCMC model. The blue line is the mean, and the shaded areas are the 95% CI. Basically, the more of the distrubition above zero, the more confident we are that the interaction is positive (that Cassin's Finches are moving upslope).
