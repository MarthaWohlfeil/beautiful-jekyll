This is a post that I have been wanting to write for some time now. I use JAGS (Just Another Gibbs Sampler) on almost a daily basis to run the models for my disserataion research, but I have to admit, it was a real struggle to learn. My hope in this post is to cover: 

1. Why use JAGS? 
2. Downloading the necessary software 
3. Introducing the components of a JAGS model 
4. Running the model and examining the outputs
